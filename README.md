# Scott StJohn's Portfolio

## This is the Portfolio of Scott StJohn

Hello, World! In this portfolio, you will find some brief information about me as well as some projects I have been working on. You will also find a placeholder where my future projects will go.

I learned so much working on this. It was a very fun project to create something completely from scratch and to see the finish project after.

This is the first project starting from scratch I have completed.
